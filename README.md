# 🕵️‍♂️ CrawlView

**“See your site the way bots and attackers do.”**

**CrawlView** is a modular, actor-based web visibility scanner designed to help developers and security-conscious teams
understand what parts of their websites are publicly exposed, easily scrapable, or vulnerable to abuse. Think of it as a
security-focused crawler and scraper simulator with automation-first architecture.

> 🧑‍💻 I created CrawlView during contract work to test visibility and scraping exposure across the various websites I
> was building — helping teams catch weak tokens, overly visible APIs, and content leaking to scrapers.

## 🔍 Why CrawlView?

Modern web apps often expose more than intended — through leaky tokens, unguarded APIs, or overly verbose metadata. *
*CrawlView** simulates how bots, scrapers, or malicious actors might interact with your public-facing site and
highlights risks *before they’re exploited*.

## ✨ Features

- ⚙️ **Actor-based backend** for parallel, modular crawling and scanning
- 🕸️ **Smart HTML & API crawler** with configurable depth and scope
- 🔁 **Rotating proxy support** and custom User-Agent profiles
- 🔒 **Security header checks** and sensitive data detection
- 🤖 **robots.txt-aware** (or optionally bypass it)
- 🪙 **Token cracker plugins** for weak or guessable token detection (e.g., JWT, API keys)
- 📊 **Rate limiting analysis** to simulate scraping or spam behavior
- 🧠 **SEO-conscious**: emulate Googlebot vs generic bots and compare treatment
- 🧰 **Flexible output formats**: JSON, HTML reports, SQLite, terminal tail
- 🖥️ **GUI and headless CLI modes** — run with a web UI or integrate in CI/CD

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crawlview.git
cd crawlview

# Build CLI
go build -o crawlview ./cmd/crawlview

# Run a basic scan
./crawlview scan https://example.com \
  --depth=3 \
  --token-check=jwt \
  --ratelimit-check \
  --headers-check \
  --respect-robots \
  --output=report.json
 ```

## 🧩 Planned Modules

- Crawler + Parser

- Header Inspector

- Token Plugins (JWT, API keys)

- Proxy Pool Support

- GUI Dashboard

- Live Stream View (WebSocket or tail)

- Export to SQLite / Markdown

- CI/CD integrations

## 🛡 Use Cases

✅ Surface analysis for security reviews

✅ DevOps checks for rate limits, secrets, exposed metadata

✅ Scraper resistance testing

✅ Pre-production & staging visibility audits

✅ Token & API key testing before going live

## 📦 Export Formats

- .json — machine-readable summary

- .html — styled visual report for security/dev teams

- .sqlite — fast querying of scan results

- .md — human-readable report for audits

- stdout — for tailing and piping

## ⚠️ Ethics & Usage

CrawlView is designed for defensive and educational purposes. Only scan sites you own or have permission to audit.

## ✨ Stay Sharp

“Security is not a feature, it’s a mindset.”

Run CrawlView. Stay ahead of scrapers, leakers, and logic holes — before someone else does.
